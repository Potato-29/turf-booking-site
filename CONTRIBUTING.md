# Contributing Guidelines

This is a project that aims to ease the process of booking sports grounds for games or events.

I'd like it if you go through these guidelines before you start contributing to this project.

#

You can refer the README to kow how to set this project up and start contributing(it's pretty simple, you know the drill).

## PR Rules

    1. All created PRs must start with issue number as prefix (Eg. [29]-Navbar issue)
    2. All commit messages must start with one of these following prefixes(feat / fix / add / update)
    3. Read the issue description first and then start working
    4. I have given an env file for the contributors, you can rename it to .env and get the database connected (it's a copy of the original dw)
